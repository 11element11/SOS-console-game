# SOS-console-game
A console based python game of "S-O-S", in which the player making most number of S-O-S combinations wins.


SOS game, a pretty fun game that i used to play in primary school, the only difference is that this one is a console game.
In this, two players are required to play against each other on a matrix board(here i've built a 6x6 board due to its time consuming game-play because its console based)

The Basic aim is tho make "S-O-S" combination in the matrix which can be either linearly or diagonally,
whoever scores more i.e builds more SOSs wins the game

HOW TO PLAY? well as its a console game you have to choose the number in a row to put the desired letter(s/o)
